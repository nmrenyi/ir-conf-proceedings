# IR Conference Proceedings Collection

This repository holds the proceedings of top-tier IR(Information Retrieval) conferences, including SIGIR, CIKM, WWW, WSDM, KDD, RecSys, etc.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a convenient way to access the proceedings of top-tier IR conferences. ACM Digital Library, an official source of these proceedings, is not quite convenient to use. Here we are trying to make a table of papers in each proceeding, with 4 columns: title, authors, abstract and paper link.

Sometimes, the official site of each conference provides a plain HTML version of its proceeding with full metadata, which makes it easy to read. We made a table to show that:
